About this project.
The goal of this project is to build a model which predicts the number of accidents in Chicago based on weather conditions, such as high humidity at night time, rain during the morning hours, and other features. With this project I want to show how regularization helps to fit the stable model to data. 

Data on Daily Weather Condition was collected from Weather Underground website, you can open it with the folowing link: https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/il/chicago/KMDW/date
And the notebook with the scraping code of Chicago weater condition can be find here: http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Metis/Metis-Bootcamp/projects/02-luther/Scrape_Weather.ipynb

Data on Car Accidents was collected from Chicago Data Portal website, you can open it with the folowing link: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if
The notebook with the scraping code of Car Accidents in Chicago can be find here: https://github.com/natalipivnitskaya/Metis-Bootcamp/blob/master/projects/02-luther/Scrape_Traffic_Crashes.ipynb


Process: acquired data from Weather Underground and Chicago Data Portal, feature engineering, applied regression techniques, including regulariztion technique.
